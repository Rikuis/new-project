# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is about finding out how to improve healthcare of diabetics. Exactly how to improve people with sensor and insulinepump to calculate their basic basal standards.


## Background

The problem solved with AI could be great for diabetics healtcare. It could solve easily what would be correct basal.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* reading values 
* calculating values
* calculating correct basal


## How is it used?

In this process we should have the code for the values calculation and every bolus taken and food eaten.
We should have these to calculate right basal value.
This should take at least a week from person with diabetes to get nessessary values.


## Data sources and AI methods

Data would be coming from diffrent app like nightscout or same kind of app.
To get data to nightscout you need to have another app for reading sensor data.

## Challenges

Challenge is with getting values and also getting all nessessary informations about eating and moving.

## What next?

This project could go towards artificial pancreas.
